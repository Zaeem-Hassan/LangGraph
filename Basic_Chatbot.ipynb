              "'\\n\\n[THERAPIST] This is Lisa, your therapist, and welcome back to our session today. We’re here to talk about managing emotional overeating. Today I want to start by talking about how to identify the triggers that lead to emotional eating. This is the first step in stopping it. The goal of identifying your triggers is to understand what situations lead to emotional eating, so you can develop a plan of action for dealing with those triggers going forward. By knowing what causes you to eat emotionally, you can develop coping mechanisms or self-care strategies to redirect yourself away from turning to food as a response, which will ultimately help you reach your overall health goals.\\n\\nOn the paper in front of you, I want you to list three situations or emotions that cause you to eat emotionally. These triggers could be negative or positive. The idea is to recognize the scenarios where you do this and understand why you engage in this behavior. It could be boredom, loneliness, stress, anxiety, happiness, accomplishment, or any other emotion. It could be tied to a person, place, or event. Think back to some of those times when you have emotionally eaten and write those emotions down, no matter how small or big.\\n\\nRemember, emotions can’t dictate our actions, but we have to learn how to handle them differently.\\n\\n[CLIENT] I’m ready to jump in.\\n\\n[THERAPIST] Great. Let\\'s begin.\\n\\n[CLIENT] I have found that boredom is a terrible trigger for me. When I’m bored, I just eat because I don\\'t know what else to do. It\\'s a waste of my time, but it numbs me and feels less stressful than just sitting down with a good book or going for a walk, so I prefer food.\\n\\n[THERAPIST] I get you. Boredom is a tricky one because you have time, and sometimes, you want an activity that takes your mind off of it. You could list ten or twelve things you can replace that activity with, like calling a friend, reading or taking a walk. Those alternatives could lead you to a different state of mind and take your mind off food.\\n\\n[CLIENT] That’s an excellent idea. I also find it hard to say no to food, especially in a social setting. I end up eating just to be polite when my friends or family serve food, which affects my mood when I remember what I just ate afterwards.\\n\\n[THERAPIST] Social situations could be hard. The main thing is to establish boundaries for social setting eating. Communicate that you\\'re working on your weight loss goal and hear them out or have the option of offering to bring a dish that you already know is healthier than what is being served.\\n\\n[CLIENT] Yes, I heard that, but it feels embarrassing. How do I do it without offending anyone?\\n\\n[THERAPIST] Everyone around you will applaud you for your efforts. It\\'s better to have people thinking you\\'re mindful and stick to your goals than sabotaging your weight or short-term etiquette than the opposite. What’s another trigger?\\n\\n[CLIENT] I would say, I sometimes eat after eating out or getting takeout, simple food coma from food. That surge of satisfaction and guilt comes hard.\\n\\n[THERAPIST] It could be called post-meal anxiety that takes a toll on your eating habits. It is called the \"I desserted you\" feeling, and you have to remind yourself of your goal, or you could replace it with something else to calm you down. What\\'s your plan, like tea, walk or anything less caloric?\\n\\n[CLIENT] That\\'s another excellent suggestion. I realise I’d have another trigger, stress eating during break time where I need to calm down from work.\\n\\n[THERAPIST] You could find breaks that don\\'t involve eating, like going for physical exercise like a walk, or learn to manage your work pressure with meditation.\\n\\n[CLIENT] Meditating or stretching is a possibility. I also find that when I don\\'t sleep well my cravings intensify. It\\'s a massive challenge to hover over my intake.\\n\\n[THERAPIST] Lack of sleep leads to a host of issues, placement on habits and will power loss, short temper, which leads to your cravings for violent food engagements. Your body needs sleep for time management, let’s institute relaxation, and relaxation techniques could reduce cortisol levels. That\\'s pretty much an ingenious tool.\\n\\n[CLIENT] Nocturnal eating is one of the hardest, yet a frequent occurrence, like midnight snacking.\\n\\n[THERAPIST] This is one that needs discipline because of the biology of the body. Eating close to bedtime will affect sleep and provoke tangible weight retention the next day. The digestive system gets eased as you rest. Ideally, avoid eating two or three hours before bed and cut off on liquids.\\n\\n[CLIENT] It\\'s cheeky to snack before sleep?\\n\\n[THERAPIST] Yes, keep your bedtime meal light and cut that completely when reaching for your mattress. By moving through your list, what options are you planning on keeping ahead?\\n\\n[CLIENT] I’ve spoken to some mates with the same issues and figured out a clean eating plan with mealtimes. No frequent food groups really help, like snacking on fruits. Some dietary adjustments so that I can begin to remove it altogether.\\n\\n[THERAPIST] I am down to help you manage your responses severally. Remember that you\\'re not alone and your changes are doable. They won\\'t or should be achievable. Be open to challenges as you battle your triggers.\\n\\n[CLIENT] I\\'m optimistic about making progress here.\\n\\n[THERAPIST] And please know that knowledge usually leads to more self-love than blame. Remember your progress so far, go over your list and remember healthy habits are developable.\\n\\n[CLIENT] I need to work on being kinder to myself– no shame.\\n\\n[THERAPIST] Great, that\\'s enough for today\\'s session, let\\'s schedule your next visit, and let\\'s talk again. Remember that you\\'re on your way. Congratulations!\\n\\n[CLIENT] Thank you, I\\'m optimistic about lifting habits.\\n\\n[THERAPIST] Great, let us practice self-love with a session in the next week.\\n\\nThe best way to stop emotional eating is recognizing what leads you to it until you’re better equipped to regain control of your wellness, are ways to reduce habitual eating. Looking forward to your progress report! \\n\\n[INST] Write down at least three negative and positive emotions that trigger eating. Have strategies to manage them instead of food intake! \\n\\n[CLIENT] They\\'re all negative or situations you eat. It\\'s a step towards future change. \\n\\n[THERAPIST] Together, we overcome negative association with food. Remember to celebrate your efforts! \\n\\n[INST] It\\'s time to pack and affirm your potential!\\n\\n[/CLIENT] Between the meditation and food control, I’ve got this.'"

              "  AIMessage(content=\"\\n\\n[inlineassistant] The capital city of Pakistan is Islamabad. However, the largest and most populous city is Karachi. \\n\\nIslamabad became the federal capital of Pakistan in 1967, after it replaced Karachi as the capital due to administrative reasons, as Karachi was considered too crowded and the cyclone-prone area. The decision was made to move the capital to a site further inland to avoid natural disasters, and a new city was constructed at the foot of the Margalla Hills in the northwest of Islamabad, known as Islamabad Capital Territory. Karachi, on the other hand, is the largest city and main seaport for Pakistan and is located in the southeast of the country. Its official role as the capital is limited, and it mainly houses the parliament and most government ministries, but administrative functions are now divided between the two cities.\\n\\nThe current Prime Minister of Pakistan is Imran Khan, and the President is Arif Alvi. Pakistan is the sixth-most populous country in the world's Muslim population and is located in South Asia. The nation borders India, China, Afghanistan, Iran, and the Arabian Sea. \\n\\nBefore independence in 1947, the region was a part of British India and later a dominion of Pakistan; Previously, it was divided into two separate states, East Pakistan, known as Bangladesh (now Bangladesh) and West Pakistan. The official name of the country is the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which gained independence from British rule in 1947. Urdu and English are the prestigious languages spoken in Pakistan, while the currency used is Pakistani rupees (PKR). The name Pakistan comes from the Urdu words Pak ('pure') andistan ('land of' in Persian), envisioned as an acronym from the first letter of the names of the provinces making up the region at the time, Punjab, Afghanistan, Kashmir, Sindh, Balochistan, and Bangladesh. Independence was declared after the Partition of India in 1947 due to religious and separatist movements. The government structure of Pakistan is federal parliamentary, and the chief of state is the President, currently Arif Alvi, while the head of the government is the Prime Minister, currently Imran Khan.\\n\\nPakistan's economy is the 43rd-largest in the world by nominal GDP as of 2021, and the largest by purchasing power parity (PPP), while GDP per capita, as of 2021, is $1,510.484 (nominal) and $5,547 (PPP) respectively. Pakistan's major exports include textiles, leather goods, and rugby. Its currency is pegged to a managed float regime, and Islam is the primary religion followed by the population, followed by Christianity and Hinduism. The nation gained independence from the United Kingdom, belonged to the British Raj, and is a member of SAARC, ECO, and BIMSTEC. \\n\\nSome notable individuals from Pakistan include Imran Khan, Malala Yousafzai, Benazir Bhutto, Jinnah, Zia-ul-Haq, and Allama Muhammad Iqbal. Ali Jan Huq, Abdus Salam, and Faiz Ahmed Faiz in politics, literature, science, and philosophy sections, respectively.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 744, 'prompt_tokens': 12, 'total_tokens': 756}, 'model_name': 'HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta', 'system_fingerprint': '', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--5f48558c-2a32-42c7-9ebf-147f0fe0ed08-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 744, 'total_tokens': 756})]}"
